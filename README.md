# 🔍 Project Overview

Welcome to our string searching algorithm exploration project! 🧵🔎

## Introduction

In this project, we take a deep dive into the fascinating world of string searching algorithms. Our focus? A head-to-head comparison between two contenders:

- 🐢 **Naive String Search**: The classic, known for its simplicity.
- 🚀 **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: The speedster, celebrated for its efficiency.

## Objectives

- Explore the inner workings of these algorithms.
- Conduct performance tests on text searching scenarios.
- Analyze the results to uncover insights.

# 📊 Results

Let's unveil the findings! 📈

## Key Finding

Our research reveals that both algorithms exhibit linear time complexity for text searching. However, the Boyer-Moore algorithm consistently outpaces the Naive String Search, showcasing its superior efficiency.
